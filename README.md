## Structure
This project is composed in two parts:
### Flutter Project 
You can find all the code related to flutter on the lib Folder

### Python project
Python was used to create the speech to text function and we use it as a child process on flutter app.

### Important Files and Directories
#### audio_files
The audio_files directory is where all the audio files are stored.
#### Config.txt
#### This is a configuration file where we inform the flutter app where the speech to text python app is located so we don't need to recompile the app if we change his location.
